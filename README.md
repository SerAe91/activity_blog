# Activity Blog

> This project is also available in German: [README_DE.md](README_DE.md)

This project was developed as a **demo for job applications**. It demonstrates how I build and deploy a small fullstack application with **frontend, backend, and infrastructure**.  
My focus was on **clean structure**, **containerization**, and **deployment with Kubernetes**.

# Project Goal

This project is meant to showcase my working style:

- Development of a web application with **frontend** and **backend**
- Use of **Docker** for easy local development
- Deployment on **Kubernetes** with custom Bash scripts
- Documentation and automation as required in real-world projects

# Project Description

Users can blog their activities and experiences. They can create persons and locations and link them to activities.

> Note: This project is a **learning and showcase project**. It is not a finished product.

# Tests

- **Backend:** `backend/src/test/java/activity`
- **Frontend:** `frontend/src/app/pages/activity-list/activity-list.component.spec.ts`

> Example tests are included, but there is not 100% test coverage.

## Frontend Highlight

In the frontend, I particularly focused on the **Activity List component**.  
For example, I implemented a **smooth scroll fade effect**, demonstrating dynamic styling, DOM manipulation, and interactive UI behavior.

The code can be found in:
`frontend/src/app/pages/activity-list/activity-list.component.ts`

# Requirements

Before starting the project, make sure the following tools are installed:

## Development Mode

- **Java 17+** (for the backend with Quarkus; required because the Maven Wrapper relies on Java)
- **Maven Wrapper** (`./mvnw` is included and automatically downloads a compatible Maven version)
- **Node.js 16+** (for the Angular frontend)
- **npm** (for frontend dependencies)
- Optional: **Docker**, if backend databases are run via containers

## Kubernetes Deployment

- **Minikube** (local Kubernetes cluster)
- **kubectl** (Kubernetes CLI)
- **Docker** (for building service images)
- Note: To access services from the host, you may need to open a **Minikube tunnel** (`minikube tunnel`)


# Installation & Start

There are two ways to start the application: **development mode** or **Kubernetes deployment**.

## Development Mode

1. Make the script executable (first time only):

```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/start-in-dev-mode.sh
```

2. Run with setup on first start:

```bash
./scripts/start-in-dev-mode.sh --setup
```

3. For subsequent starts in development mode:

```bash
./scripts/start-in-dev-mode.sh
```

> The script will automatically open the frontend in your browser.

- Frontend: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
- Backend API: [http://localhost:8080/api](http://localhost:8080/api)

## Kubernetes Deployment

1. Make the script executable (once):

```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

2. Start the deployment:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

3. Open a Minikube tunnel to make all services reachable from the host:

```bash
minikube tunnel
```

- Enter your password if prompted.

4. Open the frontend in the browser:

```bash
minikube service activity-blog-frontend
```

> Flyway migrations are executed automatically.
